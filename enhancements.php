        <h1>Enhancements</h1>
        <p>This page documents the extra features I contributed that go beyond the base requirements of the project.</p>

        <h2>1. Responsive About Page Layout</h2>
        <p>I added responsive CSS using media queries for the About page, ensuring the profile cards and layout adjust for mobile and tablet devices.</p>

        <h2>2. Profile Card Hover Effects</h2>
        <p>Each profile card and image includes hover effects to enhance user interaction and make the interface more engaging.</p>

        <h2>3. Accessibility Improvements</h2>
        <p>I added <code>title</code> tooltips to navigation and footer links for screen reader accessibility and better usability.</p>

        <h2>4. Meta Tags for SEO</h2>
        <p>I added <code>meta</code> tags in the <code>header.inc</code> file to improve search engine readability and page semantics, including description and author metadata.</p>

        <h2>5. Button Hover Feedback</h2>
        <p>I improved the Apply page's user experience by adding hover styles to the Submit and Reset buttons using CSS.</p>
